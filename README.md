# python-challenge

for this python challenge I used the following resources: 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13794873/how-to-export-all-print-to-a-txt-file-in-python

- to find code that would export the code as a text file and print it to terminal (code used at the end of the script)

Ryan Freeman's comment on Slack to read file: csvpath = r"C:\Users\Albert Dudek\Workspace\python-challenge-main\PyPoll\Resources\election_data.csv"

- to read file using r before the path

Additional help from Matthew Werth, tutor and we went over with open and making sure that it was opening the csv file properly.
